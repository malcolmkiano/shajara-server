# Shajara Server
Backend framework providing data to the Shajara app

## Get Started
To spin up a copy of this server:
- Clone this repository
- `cd` into the cloned repo
- Make a fresh start of the git history - `rm -rg .git && git init`
- Install the node dependencies `npm install`
- Move the example environment file to `.env` that will be ignored by git and read by the express server - `mv example.env .env`
- Spin up a development and test database using PSQL
- Include the connection strings to these databases in the `.env` file
- Run the migrations using **Postgrator** - `npm run migrate && npm run migrate:test`
- You're ready to go! Well, right after you run `npm start` ðŸ˜…
